# kitchen-cookbook


This project is a basic recipe website built using HTML. It is part of a learning exercise to practice HTML skills and will be styled with CSS in the future.

## Project Description

The project consists of an index page with links to different recipes. The website has a simple layout and focuses on the structure and content rather than the visual design. By completing this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of HTML elements, linking pages, and organizing content on a web page.

## Skills Demonstrated

- HTML basics
- Creating links between pages
- Structuring and organizing content
