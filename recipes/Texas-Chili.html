      <!-- Directions for making the dish-->

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>Place peppers in a large skillet and heat over medium-low heat; cook, turning once, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chiles to a bowl and cover with hot water; let stand for 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Drain chiles, reserving about 1/2 cup of the soaking water. Use a paring knife to slice open each pepper, and remove and discard stems and seeds by running under a gentle stream of tap water. </li>
          <li>Combine chiles, chipotle pepper, and reserved 1/2 cup water in a blender; blend until a smooth paste forms, 15 to 30 seconds. Set aside.</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Toss beef cubes in a large bowl with salt and pepper until evenly coated. Add half of the beef to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring occasionally to brown most sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
          <li>Add onions and garlic to drippings in Dutch oven and cook, stirring constantly, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add cumin and cinnamon, and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Add blended chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Add 1/4 cup of the water and masa harina, whisking until incorporated to avoid lumps. Add stock and remaining 1 1/4 cups water and stir to combine.</li>
          <li>Add bay leaves and reserved beef and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to maintain a very low simmer and cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is thickened, about 2 hours. Stir in brown sugar and vinegar.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat and let stand for 20 minutes before serving warm with sour cream and lime wedges. </li>
        </ol>
